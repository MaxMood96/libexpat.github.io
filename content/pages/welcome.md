# What is Expat?

Welcome to Expat, a stream-oriented XML parser library written in C.<br/>
Expat excels with files too large to fit RAM, and
where performance and flexibility are crucial.

There are a number of [applications and libraries using Expat](doc/users/),
as well as [bindings and 3rd-party wrappers](doc/bindings/).
Expat is [packaged everywhere](doc/packages/).

Please continue reading with:

 * [Getting Started](doc/getting-started/)
 * [XML Security](doc/xml-security/)
 * [Common Pitfalls](doc/common-pitfalls/)

If you have found a bug,
please [report it](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues) so it gets fixed.
Thank you!

The Expat development team
